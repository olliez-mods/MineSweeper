# MineSweeper
Minesweeper but made by me.

If you're unsure how to play minesweeper the rules can be found on the internet. here are controls.

Click anywhere to start (can't die on first click).

Right clicking flags a mine and prevents it from exploding when you click on it.

left clicking a square revels what it is (if it's a mine you lose).

Flag all the mines to win.



This was last updated with SFML 3.0.0, on a macbook (hence the resource path files) but should all work on windows too
