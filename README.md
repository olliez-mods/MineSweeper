# MineSweeper
Minesweeper but made by me.

[Video Demo](https://youtu.be/uoBxmhNjguw)

If you're unsure how to play minesweeper the rules can be found on the internet. here are the controls.

Click anywhere to start (can't die on the first click).

Right-clicking flags a mine and prevents it from exploding when you click on it.

left-clicking a square reveals what it is (if it's a mine you lose).

Flag all the mines to win.
